### Disclaimer ⚠️
> There's a second version of this challenge available at the threads-challenge-v2 branch.

# Threads Challenge N1 Activity (EC6)
This is the N1 activity of the Programming Language subject, and it will compose the N1 grade for the 2 Bim.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
